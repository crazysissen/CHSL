The Crazy High Standards Library! 
Basically just a garbage always-in-development collection of useful utilities that the dev uses when making games and stuff.

All this code is probably too smelly for any one worth their salt to use, however if any brave adventurers out there refuse to heed my warning, just stick it in your project. There is no CHSPD to chase you down.
